# TODO
- add "lazy-loading" message about number of available updates to `.bashrc` 
- how to handle `bash` history, not syncing looses data, syncing slows down workflow, maybe `zsh` sloves this.
- `vim` `!grep -rni CURRENT_WORD` shortcut
- `vim` create function for `:set scrollbind` for all splits in current tab
- `vs ?` should be launchable on top of another open vim session
- `vs ?` should sort sessions by the time they were used last time
- make `vim` file autocomplete better (bash-like)
- make `vim` highlights changed lines (against git)
- vim Ctrl+w split switching is way too hard to press #isThisEmacs
- auto check & install dependencies (`i3blocks` stuff, ...)
- headless OPTION in `~/.dotfiles/headless` (1 = yes, 0 = no) -> don't install gui stuff on headless machines
- start using `zsh`, include configs 
- track vim sessions using `/tmp` rather than using shell variable - can't be set from within `vim`
- update `README` to describe all parts of dotfiles (dotfiles, pacsync, distro_paths)
